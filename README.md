# D3D11Cube
DirectX 11 Cube with shaders written in C++

Run the solution and bask in the glory of 100+ wasted hours.
Full of bugs that i need to sort out and highly unstable.
You can play around with the viewport to change the camera angle and FOV.
You can directly modify the object mesh within the code (working on a method to import mesh directly from .max files).
Work - in - progress for a D3D Engine in C++
